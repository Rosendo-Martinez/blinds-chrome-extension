# Blinds Chrome Extension

This project is a Google Chrome extension that makes it easier for
users to focus on the important elements of websites by using 'blinds' to obscure the distracting elements. 


It uses the **Chrome API** to inject and execute Javascript, and to insert CSS into the web page. 


This extension is **published on the Google Chrome Web Store**. If you would like to install on your browser, [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blinds/kicfjmbfgddfepipepddkahkfldnaaoi) is the link to it.
